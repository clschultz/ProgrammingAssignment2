## The following functions facilitate calculation of the inverse of a square
## matrix.  If the value has already been calculated the resulting inversion
## matrix is pulled from a cache store.


## makeCacheMatrix - creates a special matrix with a list of functions to:
## 1) set the value of the matrix
## 2) get the value of the matrix
## 3) set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4) get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve - returns the inverse of square matrix.  If the inverse has
## already been calculated it is pulled from the cache store

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
